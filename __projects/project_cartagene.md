    content: "Our goal was to build a platform that is user friendly, scalable and flexible enough for other groups to adopt and use for collecting health data across Canada. This included tools to build the [survey](https://cartagene.qc.ca/en){:target=\"_blank\"} as well as two separate platforms that ensure participant identity is kept confidential."
