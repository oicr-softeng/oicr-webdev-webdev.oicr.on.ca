    FACIT is planning to leverage the framework of OTIS to create an analogous,
    online, searchable tool for its portfolio of investments; this tool will be
    referred to as FIDO (FACIT’s Innovation Database Online).  Currently,
    multiple databases exist within FACIT’s file network that capture important
    information on FACIT’s investments. If a team member has a question about a
    particular investment, an email is typically sent to the team, and one (or
    more) of these databases is consulted to find the answer. Developing FIDO
    will allow each team member to independently perform this search.
