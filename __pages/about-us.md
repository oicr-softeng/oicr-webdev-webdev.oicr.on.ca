      OICR's Web Development team is a multi-disciplinary team capable of
      designing and building website and web applications for researchers and
      their projects. The 5-10 member team is composed of creative and technical
      members, working on 50+ projects servicing OICR's research programs and
      Collaboration projects. Through its designed web services, the team
      provides improved access and understanding of the data being provided,
      which in turn, may lead to more fruitful scientific discoveries. 
    - >-
      The team applies rapid and intelligent design analysis, and agile project
      implementation thereby enabling programs to focus on the high-value
      benefits for their users.  The team has knowledge and experience of three
      discrete sciences to which we describe with the team's internal mission of
      Align, Connect and Reuse, and these are namely Human-Computer Interaction
      (connect), Molecular Biology/Bioinformatics (align), and Software
      Engineering / Computing (reuse).
